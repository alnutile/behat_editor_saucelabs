After you enable the module you will need to visit composer_manager [admin/config/system/composer-manager]
and allow it to rebuild composer.json from the composer.json file in this modules folder.

You may have to install libraries running
drush bsl
this will install the libraries

WARNING if you get stuck and drupal will not load run
drush rr



After that you need to put your Saucelabs info into the admin area here
[admin/config/system/behat-editor/sauce-labs]

You can get your API on the lower left of the screen once you log in on the Dashboard.

This will all go into your behat.yml file in the behat folder of this module.
See the behat.yml.sample file that is in that folder.

Note: to make sure tests run on sauceleabs see the behat.yml.sample file
