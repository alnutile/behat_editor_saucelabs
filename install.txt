After you enable the module you will need to visit composer_manager [admin/config/system/composer-manager]
and allow it to rebuild composer.json from the composer.json file in this modules folder.

After that you need to put your Saucelabs info into the admin area here
[admin/config/system/behat-editor/sauce-labs]

You can get your API on the lower left of the screen once you log in on the Dashboard.

This will all go into your behat.yml file in the behat folder of this module.
See the behat.yml.sample file that is in that folder.

## Todo
There is a bug right now that the composer manage may not pick up the auotload noted in the composer.json
for now I am just inserting it into the vendor/composer/autoload_namespaces.php under the BehatEditor one.
